Most codes here are based on example codes from Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python, 2e written by John V. Guttag and published by The MIT Press. I wrote them while going through the book as part of the learning exercise. I have made small changes to some and added comments. Otherwise, the codes are very similar to those in the book - sometimes, exactly the same.
